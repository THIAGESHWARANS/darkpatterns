            <p class="text-wrapper-2">
              Recently, The Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution has asked e-commerce companies to
              not use dark patterns on their platforms. Amid a rise in online shopping and an increase in the number of
              internet users, which is expected to touch 900 million by 2025, the dark pattern has caught the attention
              of the government. The digital space has become an integral part of the consumer’s life, significantly
              influencing how they consume information, goods and services. With e-commerce and social commerce growing
              at very high-speed online consumer safety has become important.

                <p class="dark-patterns-also">
                  Dark patterns, also known as deceptive design or deceptive patterns, are essentially tricks. Websites
                  and apps use dark patterns to manipulate users into making decisions they wouldn’t have otherwise
                  made—like subscribing to a service you won’t use, agreeing to marketing emails you didn’t want, or
                  giving up your personal data.<br />Businesses and consumers alike need to be aware of these patterns.
                  Knowing how to recognize dark patterns means you’re far less likely to fall victim to one or to
                  unintentionally introduce one in your own organization’s website or app.

                        Ever had a cookie pop-up beg and plead with you to accept cookies, almost as though you were
                        hurting somebody’s feelings by rejecting cookies? That would be confirm-shaming, in which the
                        user is emotionally manipulated into performing some action they would not have done otherwise.

                        A hard-to-cancel pattern is exactly what it sounds like: it’s easier to opt into data processing
                        than it is to opt out. It’s pretty common in cookie popups—you might need to make one click to
                        accept cookies, but multiple clicks to opt out.

                    Alternatively, the language used to convey important information could be vague, unclear, and
                    misleading. Perhaps that cookie banner does mention that your data will be sold to third parties if
                    you agree, so long as you read between the lines.

                  Instagram allows users to deactivate their account through the app, but they must visit the website if
                  they want to delete the account.<br />Many websites and apps trick their users into allowing them to
                  track their location or gather their data. For example, Instagram uses terms like ‘activity’ and
                  ‘personalised’ instead of ‘tracking’ and ‘targeting’.<br />Certain dating apps require the user to
                  type the word ‘delete’ if they want to delete their account permanently. The pop-up showing ‘yes’ and
                  ‘no’ options has been removed. In short, they have made it difficult to delete accounts by the user.

                Recently, regulators in jurisdictions such as the European Union, USA and UK have acted against dark
                patterns.<br />The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) of the U.K. has listed different
                pressure-selling techniques that it believes violate consumer protection laws and for which actions will
                be taken.<br />In 2022, the European Data Protection Board released guidelines that gave designers and
                users of social media platforms practical guidance on how to spot and avoid dark patterns that are in
                violation of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) laws.<br />In 2021, California passed amendments
                to the California Consumer Privacy Act, banning dark patterns that made it difficult for consumers to
                exercise legal rights, like opting out of the sale of their data.<br />In 2019, the UK issued a set of
                guidelines which prohibited companies from using dark patterns which influence underage users to have
                low privacy settings. These guidelines were later made enforceable under its Data Protection Act, 2018.
